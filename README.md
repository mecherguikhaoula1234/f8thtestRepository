The task is to create a native Android app. The app must be hidden into the background in the initial loading state. When the button "volume down" is pressed 3 times consecutively, 
it will toggle the visibility of the app (hidden/visible)


1/ I created a service called serviceForBackgroundForegroundRunnig in order to :manage the running of the app in background or in forground and listen for the clicks on the button "volume down" and also the number of Clicks
    
2/ A principal Activity called MainActivity and its layout activity_main
